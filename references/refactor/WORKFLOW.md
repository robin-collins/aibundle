## Step 9: Implement Refactoring in Stages

Now you can follow the refactoring plan, stage by stage:

```bash
# For each stage, create a new branch
git checkout -b stage1-basic-module-structure

# Implement Stage 1 changes...

# Commit Stage 1 changes
git add .
git commit -m "Stage 1: Create basic module structure"

# Continue for subsequent stages
git checkout -b stage2-extract-constants-and-types
# ... and so on
```

## Step 10: Testing the Refactored Code

After each stage, verify the code compiles and (when applicable) runs correctly:

```bash
# Check that the code compiles
cargo check

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the project (once it's functional)
cargo run
```

## Recommended Workflow for Implementing Each Stage

For each stage in the refactoring plan:

1. Create a new branch from the previous stage's branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b stage<N>-<description>
   ```

2. Implement the changes according to the refactoring plan for that stage

3. Compile and test:
   ```bash
   cargo check
   cargo test  # When you have tests
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Stage <N>: <description>"
   ```

5. After completing all stages, you can merge everything back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge stage<final>-<description>
   ```

## Additional Tips

1. **Cargo Add**: If you have `cargo-edit` installed, you can add dependencies more easily:
   ```bash
   cargo add clap --features derive
   cargo add crossterm ratatui walkdir glob ignore
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Documentation**: Add rustdoc comments as you implement:
   ```rust
   /// Brief description of function
   /// 
   /// # Examples
   /// 
   /// ```
   /// let result = module::function();
   /// assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
   /// ```
   pub fn function() -> ReturnType { /* ... */ }
   ```

3. **Unit Tests**: Add tests as you implement each module:
   ```rust
   #[cfg(test)]
   mod tests {
       use super::*;
       
       #[test]
       fn test_function() {
           // Test implementation
       }
   }
   ```
