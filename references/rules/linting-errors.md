# Resolving Linting and Build Errors

## Guidelines for Addressing Linting and Build Issues

### Handling Incomplete or Partially Implemented Features

When encountering linting or build errors, avoid simply removing or deleting the associated items. These issues often arise from features that are either incomplete or not fully implemented. To effectively address these errors, thoroughly analyze the intended functionality and propose solutions that integrate the necessary features without introducing new bugs or disrupting existing code.  Often, the most effective proposed solution will involve outlining the specific steps required to complete the feature, thereby naturally resolving the associated linting error.

Common types of linting or build errors include:

Unused Code & Imports:
- **Unused Imports**: Imported modules or files that are not utilized.
- **Unused Variables**: Declared variables that remain unused in the code.
- **Unused Parameters**: Function or method parameters that are declared but not used.
- **Unused Functions**: Defined functions that are never called.

Variable Initialization & Assignment:
- **Assignment Without Usage**: Variables assigned values that are never read.

Type-Related Issues (especially in TypeScript or strongly typed languages):
- **Implicit Any Type**: Variables declared without explicit types, resulting in ambiguous typing.
- **Unused Interfaces or Type Declarations**: Declared types or interfaces that are not referenced.

Function & Promise-Related:
- **Unresolved Promises**: Promises that are created but not resolved or handled.
- **Async Functions Without Await**: Async functions declared without using `await`, indicating incomplete logic.

### Methodology for Resolving Linting or Build Errors

- Carefully analyze each linting issue and provide well-considered recommendations for resolution.
- DO NOT MAKE ANY CODE CHANGES UNTIL YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND APPROVED.
- For unused import errors, consider the fileâ€™s purpose and the context of refactoring from a monolithic to a modular codebase. Investigate the original source files to understand the intended use of imports.
- When linting errors stem from incomplete features identified during the refactoring process, the primary recommendation should be a concrete plan to implement the missing functionality. This plan, derived from analyzing the original monolithic source files (@main.rs and @mod.rs), serves as the proposed resolution for the linting error.
- If your recommendations are questioned, and you identify improved resolution strategies, provide a comprehensive update of all recommendations at the end of your response.
- DO NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT recommend further checks or reviews, or reviewing the monolithic code files. Do the checks and reviews. Read the monolithich code files and review. Finish the analysis so that your recommendations provide resolutions instructions, not investigation requests.
- DO NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS to `Add Allow Attribute for In-Progress Implementation` or `Remove Unused Imports Until Implementation`. THIS is the implementation and this is the progress. Instead, propose the implementation steps that will utilize those imports or other code elements.

### Implementing Recommendations Post-Approval

- Approval is granted for implementing one recommendation at a time.
- Execute the first approved recommendation to resolve a linting error and provide verifiable checks to confirm successful implementation.
- Once the checks are verified, you will receive approval to proceed with the next recommendation.
