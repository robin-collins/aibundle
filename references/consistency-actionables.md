## Recommendations to Resolve Remaining Inconsistencies and Duplications

Below are clear, actionable steps to address the minor consistency, duplication, and style issues noted in the modular codebase review:

---

### 1. **Centralize Configuration Paths and Logic**

**Problem:**
`config_file_path` and related config loading logic are present in both `src/cli/options.rs` and `src/config/mod.rs`.

**Instruction:**
- Move all configuration file path logic and config loading/saving routines exclusively into `src/config/mod.rs`.
- In any other module that needs to deal with config, *import these functions directly from the config module*.
- Remove or refactor any duplicate code in `src/cli/options.rs` so it relies solely on the config module.

**Benefit:**
Future config changes (e.g., a new config location) are made in one place and instantly affect the whole codebase.

---

### 2. **Unify Constants and Remove Redundancy**

**Problem:**
Definitions such as ICONS, DEFAULT_IGNORED_DIRS, and language extensions exist (partially redundantly) in several places.

**Instruction:**
- Move all icons, ignored directory names, and related constants into `src/models/constants.rs`.
- Ensure *all other parts of the codebase* reference these constants via imports, not by local redefinition or copy-paste.
- If there are format-specific variations that are needed (e.g., extra icons), explicitly comment or distinguish these, but only do so when necessary.

**Benefit:**
Prevents drift, reduces "magic values," and streamlines adding or updating file types/icons.

---

### 3. **Deduplicate and Canonicalize Model and Enum Definitions**

**Problem:**
Types like `IgnoreConfig` and others exist in both `app_config.rs` and `enums.rs`.

**Instruction:**
- Choose a single module (preferably `src/models/app_config.rs`) as the canonical location for shared data types and enums.
- Remove any duplicate structs or enums elsewhere; re-export if you wish a public facing API.
- Ensure all code, including TUI, CLI, and output modules, imports and uses the canonical type.
- For enums that have methods or more complex logic (e.g., `OutputFormat`), keep data and logic together in a single definition.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates ambiguity about which definition to use and helps prevent desynchronization during refactors.

---

### 4. **Audit and Standardize Naming Conventions**

**Problem:**
Minor naming inconsistencies (e.g., `get_output_format` vs. `string_to_output_format`, `toggle_folder_expansion` vs. `toggle_folder_expansion_recursive`).

**Instruction:**
- Review all helper/utility function names for output format, config, and file operations; select one consistent, descriptive style (e.g., always `get_*`, `set_*`, `to_*`, or `convert_*` as appropriate).
- Rename older variants to match; remove/merge any fully redundant helpers.
- In event handler code, ensure function names describe their precise operation and (if needed) update comments for clarity.

**Benefit:**
Improves discoverability and maintains a professional style across the codebase.

---

### 5. **Remove or Refactor Legacy Compatibility in App**

**Problem:**
In `src/tui/app.rs`, there are fields and synchronization functions (`sync_state_to_properties`, etc.) retained for compatibility with the monolithic design.

**Instruction:**
- Identify which of these legacy fields/functions are no longer used by any code outside of `App` and determine their necessity.
- Remove unused or redundant fields/methods.
- For remaining ones, add `TODO` comments to flag these for eventual removal as the codebase fully adopts the modular API.

**Benefit:**
Reduces maintenance burden, clarifies responsibilities, and moves the codebase away from monolithic dependencies.

---

### 6. **Improve Documentation and Comments**

**Problem:**
Some modules, methods, or major structures lack module-level doc comments or documentation for public/exported APIs.

**Instruction:**
- Add a doc comment at the top of each module (`//! ...`).
- For each public enum, struct, or function, add at least a one-line description of its purpose.
- In complex methods (especially those performing tricky state/UI or file ops), consider using inline comments to clarify logic or decisions.

**Benefit:**
Makes onboarding for new developers far easier and improves long-term maintainability and auditability.

---

### 7. **UI/UX Consistency for Configuration Overwrite**

**Problem:**
TUI config save operation currently warns (but does not prompt) before overwrite, while CLI allows interactive confirmation.

**Instruction:**
- Implement a proper interactive "confirm overwrite" modal in the TUI before overwriting existing config files.
- If possible, reuse or extend existing modal infrastructure for consistent look/feel.
- Ensure user feedback/UI is consistent across CLI and TUI for critical actions.

**Benefit:**
Protects against accidental config loss and maintains professional user experience.
