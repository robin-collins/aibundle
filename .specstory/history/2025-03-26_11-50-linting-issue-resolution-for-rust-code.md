Your response should include for each linting issue:

1. **Issue Analysis**:
   - Identify the type of linting error (unused code, type issue, etc.)
   - Analyze the intended functionality by referencing the relevant sections in the monolithic version @main.rs &  @mod.rs 
   - Explain how this issue impacts the codebase

2. **Proposed Resolution**:
   - Provide detailed resolution steps that preserve intended functionality
   - Reference specific sections from the monolithic version  @main.rs & @mod.rs  that inform your recommendation
   - Explain how your solution integrates with existing code
   - DO NOT simply recommend removing code unless absolutely necessary

Present your recommendations. Include all necessary code snippets and explain any tradeoffs in your approach.
DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE RULES Adhering to @linting-errors.md  rules, provide comprehensive solutions for the following specified linting issues. Adhere to them strictly. Do not overlook any of the rules.

Okay, let's analyze the linting error in `src/tui/state/search.rs` according to the guidelines in `rules/linting-errors.md`.

**Linting Issue:**

*   **File:** `src/tui/state/search.rs`
*   **Error:** `unused import: std::collections::HashSet` (Line 2)

---

**1. Issue Analysis**

*   **Error Type:** This is an "Unused Imports" error. The `HashSet` collection type from the standard library is imported but not currently used anywhere within the `src/tui/state/search.rs` file.
*   **Intended Functionality:** In the monolithic version (`monolithic/main.rs`), `HashSet<PathBuf>` is crucially used within the `App` struct (specifically the `selected_items` field, see ```613:613:monolithic/main.rs```) to manage the set of files and folders selected by the user in the TUI. It's also used for `expanded_folders` (```619:619:monolithic/main.rs```). Functions like `toggle_selection` (```976:1019:monolithic/main.rs```), `toggle_select_all` (```1021:1073:monolithic/main.rs```), and `update_folder_selection` (```1332:1357:monolithic/main.rs```) directly interact with this `selected_items` HashSet. The `search.rs` module in the refactored codebase is intended to handle state related to searching and filtering the file list. The selection state (`selected_items`) is closely tied to this, as selections need to operate correctly on both the full list and the filtered list presented during a search.
*   **Impact:** The unused import indicates that the selection management functionality, which relies on `HashSet`, has not yet been implemented or integrated into the new modular structure, specifically within or in conjunction with the search state management. Simply removing the import, as suggested by the basic lint hint, would ignore the need for this core feature, leaving the application incomplete compared to the original monolithic version.

**2. Proposed Resolution**

The resolution is to implement the selection management functionality, which will naturally utilize the `HashSet` import.

*   **Detailed Steps:**
    1.  **Retain Import:** Keep the `use std::collections::HashSet;` line in `src/tui/state/search.rs` as it will be needed.
    2.  **Integrate Selection State:** Introduce a `selected_items: HashSet<PathBuf>` field into the appropriate state struct that manages the TUI's overall state (likely `AppState` or a similar central struct). This mirrors the structure in ```613:613:monolithic/main.rs```.
    3.  **Implement Selection Logic:**
        *   Create functions (or methods on the state struct) to handle adding/removing individual items from the `selected_items` HashSet, similar to `toggle_selection` in ```976:1019:monolithic/main.rs```. This logic must correctly identify the item to toggle based on the current list view (which might be filtered by the search state).
        *   Implement a function to handle selecting or deselecting all *visible* items, similar to `toggle_select_all` in ```1021:1073:monolithic/main.rs```. This function needs access to the search state (e.g., `is_searching` and `filtered_items` from the monolithic `App` struct ```621:622:monolithic/main.rs```) to determine whether to operate on the full list of items or the currently filtered list. It will then add or remove the relevant `PathBuf`s from the `selected_items` HashSet.
    4.  **Connect to UI:** Ensure that user actions in the TUI (e.g., pressing the selection key, select-all key) call these newly implemented state management functions. The UI rendering logic should also be updated to visually indicate which items in the list are present in the `selected_items` HashSet.

*   **Rationale & Integration:** This approach directly addresses the missing functionality identified by the unused import. By implementing the selection mechanism as it existed in the monolithic version, referencing ```613:613:monolithic/main.rs```, ```976:1019:monolithic/main.rs```, and ```1021:1073:monolithic/main.rs```, we utilize the `HashSet` import correctly and restore a core piece of user interaction. This integrates naturally with the search state because selection operations must be aware of whether the list is currently filtered.

This plan fulfills the requirement from `rules/linting-errors.md` to propose implementation steps that utilize the code element (the `HashSet` import) rather than removing it.

Please let me know if you approve this proposed resolution plan. Once approved, we can proceed with implementing the first step.

i approve, plese go ahead

_**Assistant**_

I'll help implement the selection management functionality. First, I need to examine the current state of the search module to properly integrate the changes.

---

Read file: src/tui/state/search.rs

---

Based on the file contents and following the monolithic implementation, I'll now implement the selection management functionality. We'll extend the `SearchState` struct to include selection management since it's closely tied to the search functionality, especially when handling selections during filtered views.
