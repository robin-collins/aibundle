the pub fn is_path_ignored, what is the effect of its input being &Path vs &PathBuf, do we need two functions, one for each?

# Path vs PathBuf in Rust

You're asking about the difference between using `&Path` versus `&PathBuf` as the parameter type for the `is_path_ignored` function.

## &Path vs &PathBuf

The short answer is that you don't need two separate functions. Using `&Path` as the parameter type is actually the better choice because:

1. **It's more flexible**: `&Path` can accept both `&Path` and `&PathBuf` arguments (because `PathBuf` implements `Deref` to `Path`).

2. **It follows Rust best practices**: Generally, you should use `&Path` for function parameters when you just need to read a path, and use `PathBuf` for owned paths or return values.

The current implementation is already optimal:

```rust:src/tui/state/app_state.rs
pub fn is_path_ignored(&self, path: &Path) -> bool {
    // ... existing implementation ...
}
```

## Why This Works

In Rust:
- `Path` is to `PathBuf` as `str` is to `String`
- `Path` represents a borrowed slice of a path
- `PathBuf` is an owned, mutable path that can be modified

Since `PathBuf` implements `Deref` to `Path`, any function that takes a `&Path` can automatically accept a `&PathBuf` without needing an explicit conversion or a separate function.

## Recommendation

Keep using `&Path` as the parameter type for your `is_path_ignored` function. This follows the style guidance in your cursor rules and provides the most flexible interface without sacrificing functionality.

If you were to create a function that takes `&PathBuf` instead, it would be less flexible since it couldn't directly accept other types that dereference to `Path`.
