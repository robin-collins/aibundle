# Clipboard Functionality and Event Handling Issues (2025-04-01 12:24:24)

pressing the `c` key or when you quit the app is not copying anything to clipboard, nor displaying the stats of the copy

Okay, I understand the issue. It seems like the clipboard functionality, triggered by pressing 'c' or quitting the app, isn't working as expected, and the copy statistics aren't being displayed either.

To figure out what's going wrong, I need to look at the code responsible for:

1.  Handling keyboard input, specifically the 'c' key.
2.  Handling the application quit event.
3.  Interacting with the system clipboard.
4.  Calculating and displaying the copy statistics.

Could you point me to the files or sections of code that handle these parts of the application? If you're not sure, I can try searching the codebase for relevant keywords like `clipboard`, `copy`, `event handling`, `quit`, or `stats`.

The currently open file, `monolithic/fs/mod.rs`, seems related to file system operations, which might be involved in *what* gets copied, but likely doesn't contain the core logic for event handling or clipboard interaction itself.

Thanks for providing the `src` directory structure.

Based on the names, the following directories seem most relevant to the clipboard issue:

*   `main.rs`: This is likely the application's entry point and might contain the main event loop where key presses and quit events are handled.
*   `tui/`: This directory probably handles the Terminal User Interface, including capturing keyboard input like the 'c' key.
*   `clipboard/`: This directory seems specifically dedicated to clipboard operations.
*   `output/`: This might be involved in displaying the final statistics message.

To start diagnosing the problem, I'll first check the contents of the `tui/` and `clipboard/` directories to see what files are inside. Then, I'll examine `src/main.rs` to understand how events are processed and how the clipboard functionality is triggered.

Okay, we have:

*   `src/clipboard/mod.rs`: This single file likely contains all the clipboard logic.
*   `src/tui/`: This has several subdirectories and files. `app.rs` and the `handlers/` directory seem particularly relevant for event handling.

I'll start by reading `src/tui/app.rs` to see how it handles input events, especially the 'c' key and quit signals. Then I'll look into `src/clipboard/mod.rs`.



---

Read file: src/tui/app.rs

Okay, I've reviewed `src/tui/app.rs`. Here's what I found:

1.  **Event Handling:** The main loop in the `run` function correctly polls for events and calls `KeyboardHandler::handle_key` when a key is pressed (```145:151:src/tui/app.rs```). This is where the 'c' key logic should reside.
2.  **Quit Logic:** The loop continues as long as `self.state.quit` is false (```124:124:src/tui/app.rs```). The `KeyboardHandler` is expected to set this to `true` upon receiving the quit command (likely 'q').
3.  **Statistics Display:** After the loop terminates (app quits), there is code to display the copy statistics (```158:174:src/tui/app.rs```). This code relies on `self.state.last_copy_stats` being populated *before* the app quits. It also calls `crate::clipboard::get_clipboard_contents()` to fetch the actual content for line/size calculation.
4.  **Potential Issue:** The code *displays* stats on quit if `last_copy_stats` exists, but I don't see an explicit call *within this file* to perform the copy operation *when* quitting or when 'c' is pressed. The responsibility seems delegated entirely to the `KeyboardHandler` and potentially the `ClipboardHandler`.

It appears the core issue likely lies within the handlers or the clipboard module itself. The `KeyboardHandler` might not be correctly:

*   Triggering the copy operation when 'c' is pressed.
*   Setting the `last_copy_stats` in the `AppState` after a successful copy.
*   Triggering a final copy operation *before* setting `state.quit = true` if copying on quit is intended behavior.

My next step is to investigate the event handlers. I'll check the contents of the `src/tui/handlers/` directory first.

Okay, we have `keyboard.rs` and `clipboard.rs` within the `handlers` directory.

I'll now read `src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs` to see how it handles the 'c' key press and the quit action ('q').



---

Read file: src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs

---

Okay, I've examined `src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs` and found the likely cause of the issue.

Here's what the code currently does:

1.  **'c' key:** There is **no action** defined for pressing the plain 'c' key. The copy action is currently bound to the 'y' key (presumably for "yank"):
    ```103:103:src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs
                    KeyCode::Char('y') => ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard(app_state),
    ```
2.  **Quit ('q' or Ctrl+C):** When you press 'q' or Ctrl+C, the code simply sets a flag to exit the application (`app_state.quit = true;`). It **does not** perform a copy operation before quitting:
    ```65:66:src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs
                    KeyCode::Char('q') => { app_state.quit = true; Ok(()) }
                    KeyCode::Char('c') if key_event.modifiers == KeyModifiers::CONTROL => { app_state.quit = true; Ok(()) }
    ```

Because no copy operation is triggered when you press 'c' or quit, nothing is copied to the clipboard, and the `last_copy_stats` variable (which `app.rs` uses to display stats) is never updated in those scenarios.

**To fix this, we can:**

1.  Change the keybinding for copying from 'y' to 'c'.
2.  Modify the quit handlers ('q' and Ctrl+C) to perform the copy operation *before* setting the `quit` flag.

Do you want me to make these changes? This would involve modifying `src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs`.

Okay, I will modify `src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs` to:

1.  Bind the copy action to the 'c' key instead of 'y'.
2.  Trigger the copy action when 'q' or Ctrl+C is pressed before quitting.

First, I need to read the file content again to ensure the edit is applied correctly.

```12:12:src/tui/app.rs
use crate::tui::handlers::{ClipboardHandler, FileOpsHandler, KeyboardHandler};
```
```158:174:src/tui/app.rs
        // Print final statistics if anything was copied
        if let Some(stats) = &self.state.last_copy_stats {
            if let Ok(contents) = crate::clipboard::get_clipboard_contents() {
                let line_count = contents.lines().count();
                let byte_size = contents.len();

                    crate::utils::human_readable_size(byte_size)
                );
                println!();
            }
        }

```
```65:73:src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs
                KeyCode::Char('q') => {
                    ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard(app_state)?;
                    app_state.quit = true;
                    Ok(())
                }
                KeyCode::Char('c') if key_event.modifiers == KeyModifiers::CONTROL => {
                    ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard(app_state)?;
                    app_state.quit = true;
                    Ok(())
                }

```
```103:103:src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs
                KeyCode::Char('c') => ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard(app_state),
```

I have modified `src/tui/handlers/keyboard.rs` as requested:

1.  The `ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard` function is now called when 'c' is pressed (instead of 'y').
2.  The `ClipboardHandler::copy_selected_to_clipboard` function is now called *before* setting `app_state.quit = true` when 'q' or Ctrl+C is pressed.

This should ensure that the selected items are copied to the clipboard and the necessary state (`last_copy_stats`) is updated before the application exits, allowing the statistics to be displayed correctly by the code in `src/tui/app.rs`.

Please try running the application again and test if pressing 'c' and quitting now copy the selected items and display the stats.
