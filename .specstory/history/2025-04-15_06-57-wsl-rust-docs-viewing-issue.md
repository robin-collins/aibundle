_**Assistant**_

You are not able to view the generated Rust documentation because the command cargo doc --open tries to open the docs in your default web browser, but you are running this inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The error message shows that wslview (the tool used to open Windows browser from WSL) failed:

```
command 'wslview' did not execute successfully; exit status: 34
command stderr:
ls: cannot access 'rootfstype/': No such file or directory
/usr/bin/wslview: line 216: rootfstype/c/Windows/System32/reg.exe: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/wslview: line 308: [: -ge: unary operator expected
```

This means wslview is either not configured correctly, or your WSL environment cannot find/access the Windows registry or browser.

**How to fix and view your docs:**

1. **Manual Open:**  
   The docs were generated at:
   ```
   /home/tech/projects/aibundle-modular/target/doc/aibundle/index.html
   ```
   You can open this file manually in your Windows browser:
   - In WSL, run:
     ```bash
     explorer.exe /home/tech/projects/aibundle-modular/target/doc/aibundle/index.html
     ```
   - Or, copy the file path and open it from Windows Explorer (you may need to translate the path to your Windows mount, e.g., \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\tech\projects\aibundle-modular\target\doc\aibundle\index.html).

2. **Fix wslview:**  
   - Make sure wslview is installed:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt install wslu
     ```
   - If it is installed and still fails, it may be a WSL version or configuration issue. Sometimes, wslview expects certain Windows paths or registry keys to exist, which may not be present in all WSL setups.

3. **Alternative:**  
   - Use explorer.exe as above, or
   - Open the docs from your Windows browser by navigating to the correct path via the \\wsl$ network share.

**Summary:**  
Your docs are generated, but the automatic open failed due to a WSL/Windows integration issue. Open the HTML file manually using explorer.exe or from Windows Explorer.

If you want to troubleshoot wslview further, let me know!
