# Install aibundle using cargo (2025-06-04 17:43:06)

_**User**_

can you provide me with a suitable `cargo install` command to put the release build version of aibundle into the appropriate local filesystem

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at the current install script, it already contains the appropriate command:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

This command will:
1. Compile the package in release mode
2. Install the binary to your Cargo bin directory (usually ~/.cargo/bin)
3. Make it available in your PATH

If you want to run it with explicit release mode and features, you can use:

```bash
cargo install --path . --release
```

To install to a specific directory instead of the default Cargo bin:

```bash
cargo install --path . --root /custom/install/path
```

The current install script is already doing the right thing by building in release mode first and then installing the binary.

_**User**_

do i need to build it first, or would the install `--release` command build as well?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You don't need to build it first. The `cargo install --path . --release` command will build the package in release mode and then install it in one step.

The separate `cargo build --release` line is redundant and can be removed from the script. The install command handles both building and installation.

---

_**User**_

can you add that to my Makefile.toml instead of running the install.sh script

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me add an install task to your Makefile.toml:

---

Read file: Makefile.toml

---

I see you already have an install task that runs the install.sh script. Let me modify it to directly use the cargo install command:

---

```diff
  [tasks.install]
- script = ["scripts/install.sh"]
+ command = "cargo"
+ args = ["install", "--path", ".", "--release"]
```

---

I've updated your Makefile.toml to replace the script line with a direct cargo command. Now you can run `cargo make install` to build and install the application in release mode without using the install.sh script.
