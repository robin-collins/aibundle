(No content provided in new interactions to update this section)

## CODE STYLE

- Adhere to Rust's coding conventions.
- Use `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` regularly to identify and fix style and performance issues.  Address all warnings;  the `cargo clippy --fix` command can be helpful but manual review is crucial.  Avoid `push_str("\n")`; use `push('\n')` for better efficiency.  Prefer `&Path` over `&PathBuf` where appropriate.  Refactor functions with excessive arguments (>8) into structs.
- Address borrow checker issues by carefully managing mutable and immutable borrows, potentially using techniques like creating temporary collections or cloning values as needed to avoid conflicts.  (Added 2025-03-23 based on interaction resolving borrow checker errors).
- Avoid moving values into closures unnecessarily; clone values when necessary to preserve them for later use. (Added 2025-03-23 based on interaction resolving move errors).
- When dealing with potential borrow checker issues, consider creating temporary collections to avoid simultaneous mutable and immutable borrows. (Added 2025-03-23)
- When moving values into closures, ensure that cloning is performed to prevent move errors and maintain data availability. (Added 2025-03-23)
- When encountering borrow checker errors, consider creating a temporary collection to hold values that are both immutably and mutably borrowed. This prevents conflicts that can arise from simultaneous borrowing. (Added 2025-03-23)
- When passing values into closures, ensure the values are cloned if there is a risk of moving ownership. This ensures data remains available for later use. (Added 2025-03-23)
- When encountering borrow checker errors, consider creating temporary collections to avoid simultaneous mutable and immutable borrows.  (Added 2025-03-23)  Clone values passed into closures to prevent accidental moves. (Added 2025-03-23)
- If a constant like `VERSION` is missing, define it in `lib.rs` or `main.rs` using `pub const VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");` or import it directly using the `env!` macro. (Added 2025-03-23 based on interaction resolving linting errors)
- Ensure all imports are used; remove unused imports. (Added 2025-03-23 based on interaction resolving linting errors)
- Explicitly manage ownership of values, especially strings, to avoid borrow checker errors related to moved values.  Cloning or using references as appropriate is crucial. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Add necessary imports, such as `dirs`, for external crates used in the code. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Ensure functions have correct number of arguments and types, resolving mismatches identified during linting. (Added 2025-03-23)
-  When encountering unused imports during refactoring from a monolithic codebase, carefully evaluate if the import represents planned functionality. If so, retain the import until the functionality is implemented; otherwise, remove it. (Added 2025-03-23)
- When encountering unused variables, prefix them with an underscore (`_`) to explicitly mark them as intentionally unused. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Using `&Path` instead of `&PathBuf` for the `is_path_ignored` function input is generally preferred for efficiency when you don't need to modify the path.  A single function accepting `&Path` is sufficient, as `&PathBuf` can be implicitly dereferenced to `&Path`. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Implement `is_path_ignored` function in `AppState` to handle path filtering. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Implement `is_binary_file` function as a utility function to handle binary file detection. (Added 2025-03-23)
- Implement `is_binary_file` function as a utility function to handle binary file detection. (Added 2025-03-24 based on interaction comparing monolithic and modular code)
- Correctly clone values before moving them to prevent borrow checker errors.  The cloning should occur *before* the move, not after. (Added 2025-03-24 based on user clarification)
- Ensure that cloning happens *before* the move to prevent borrow checker errors. (Added 2025-03-24 based on user clarification)
- Utilize `HashSet` where appropriate for managing collections of paths, mirroring the monolithic codebase's functionality. (Added 2025-03-24)
- When using `HashSet` for path management, ensure functionality mirrors the monolithic codebase. (Added 2025-03-24)
- Use the `CopyStats` struct returned by formatting functions to update the application state with file and folder counts. (Added 2025-03-24)
- The `base_dir` parameter in the `add_to_tree` function, while seemingly unused in the current modular implementation, was likely a remnant from the monolithic codebase's tree-building logic.  Further investigation is needed to determine its intended purpose and whether it should be removed or repurposed. (Added 2025-03-24)
- When encountering unused imports like `std::collections::HashSet` or `std::path::Path`, carefully review the monolithic codebase (`@monolithic/main.rs` and `@monolithic/fs/mod.rs`) to determine if the functionality they represent is planned for future implementation in the modular version. If so, retain the imports; otherwise, remove them. (Added 2025-03-26)
- Retain unused imports like `std::collections::HashSet` and `std::path::Path` if they represent planned functionality from the monolithic codebase (`@monolithic/main.rs` and `@monolithic/fs/mod.rs`), even if currently unused in the modular refactoring. Implement the intended functionality to utilize these imports. (Added 2025-03-26)
- When analysis reveals a lint error stems from incomplete or missing functionality, the recommendation should include a plan to implement the necessary feature(s) to resolve the error. Approval of such a recommendation explicitly includes approval to proceed with the proposed implementation step. The goal is to complete the refactoring, not just identify unused elements. (Added 2025-03-26)
- Ensure that all modules and functions used are publicly accessible (`pub`).  Address private module errors by making the necessary modules public in their respective `mod.rs` files. (Added 2025-03-26)
- Ensure that all types used, such as `OutputFormat`, correctly implement the `FromStr` and `Default` traits as required by the compiler.  This often involves implementing these traits for custom enum types. (Added 2025-03-26)
- When encountering `no field` errors during refactoring, carefully review the monolithic codebase to determine the correct access path for the required field.  In some cases, the field might be directly accessible, or it may be nested under a different structure than anticipated. (Added 2025-03-26)
- Retain unused imports like `std::collections::HashSet` and `std::path::Path` in `src/tui/state/search.rs` if they represent planned functionality from the monolithic codebase (`@monolithic/main.rs` and `@monolithic/fs/mod.rs`).  These imports will be utilized as the search functionality is fully implemented to mirror the monolithic codebase. (Added 2025-03-27)
- Explicitly use `Path` methods when working with file paths, even if implicit dereferencing from `PathBuf` is possible. This helps clarify intent and resolve linting issues. (Added 2025-03-27)
- Ensure that the `Modal` struct has a `message` associated function to handle the modal message display. (Added 2025-03-27)  This has been addressed by using `Modal::new` for creating modal messages.  The `Modal::new` function should be used to create modal messages. (Added 2025-03-26)
- Implement `toggle_select_all` to select/deselect all currently visible items (filtered or full list) and update the `selected_items` HashSet accordingly. (Added 2025-03-27) This has been implemented.
- Implement selection logic to correctly handle adding/removing items from `selected_items` HashSet when the list is filtered by search. (Added 2025-03-27) This has been implemented.
- Remove unused `std::collections::HashSet` import from `src/tui/state/search.rs` unless it's needed for future planned functionality. (Added 2025-03-27)
- When calling `Modal::new`, provide a third `u16` argument specifying the modal height. (Added 2025-03-27)
- Add `filtered_items: Vec<PathBuf>` field to `AppState` to resolve "no field" errors related to missing `filtered_items`. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Add `search_query: String` and `is_searching: bool` fields to `AppState`. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Implement search/filtering logic to populate `filtered_items` based on `search_query` and the full `items` list. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Iterate over collections using references (`&`) to avoid sizedness errors. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Remove `filtered_indices: Option<Vec<usize>>` field from `AppState` struct. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Update `AppState::update_search` to populate `filtered_items` based on `search_query` and the full `items` list.  If no search query, clone `items` to `filtered_items`. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Update `AppState::get_display_items` to return `filtered_items`. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Remove `AppState::get_original_index` function. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Update functions using `filtered_indices` to use `filtered_items` instead. (Added 2025-03-28)
- Retain unused `std::collections::HashSet` import in `src/models/app_config.rs` as it is likely needed for future planned functionality related to state management (mirroring the monolithic codebase). (Added 2025-03-28)
- Retain unused `std::path::PathBuf` import in `src/models/app_config.rs` as it is likely needed for future planned functionality related to file system paths (mirroring the monolithic codebase). (Added 2025-03-28)
