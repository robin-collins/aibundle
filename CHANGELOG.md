## [Unreleased]

### Testing
- **Added Comprehensive GitIgnore Testing Suite**: Implemented unit tests to validate and demonstrate the critical gitignore context handling bug described in `CRITICALBUG.md`. Tests include:
  - `test_gitignore_context_issue_demonstration`: Documents current incorrect behavior
  - `test_correct_gitignore_behavior_expectations`: Defines expected correct behavior (currently failing)
  - `test_gitignore_cache_key_problem`: Demonstrates the cache key design flaw
  - `test_file_contextual_gitignore_requirements`: Documents requirements for file-contextual gitignore processing
  - Test infrastructure with nested `.gitignore` files to validate hierarchical ignore pattern handling (`src/fs/mod.rs`)

### Security
- **Fixed Symlink Loop Vulnerability**: Added symlink loop detection in `collect_folder_descendants` function to prevent infinite recursion and potential stack overflow attacks (`src/fs/mod.rs`).

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed Incorrect GitIgnore Context Handling**: Resolved fundamental design flaw where gitignore rules were applied incorrectly due to improper cache key strategy. The previous implementation used only `base_dir` as cache key, causing all files to share the same gitignore matcher regardless of their location in the directory hierarchy. Files are now properly matched against their file-contextual gitignore rules:
  - Implemented `get_cached_gitignore_matcher_for_context()` to build matchers specific to each file's directory context
  - Updated `is_path_ignored_iterative()` and `is_path_ignored_iterative_cached()` to use file's parent directory as context
  - Updated TUI ignore checking in `src/tui/state/app_state.rs` to use file-contextual matching
  - Files now properly respect nested `.gitignore` files (e.g., `src/components/Button.tsx` is correctly ignored by `src/components/.gitignore`)
  - Maintained backward compatibility through deprecated legacy function (`src/fs/mod.rs`)
- **Fixed Race Condition in Selection Operations**: Implemented proper synchronization to prevent race conditions between async selection counting and user input that could cause inconsistent application state (`src/tui/state/selection.rs`, `src/tui/app.rs`).
- **Fixed Incorrect Regex Pattern**: Corrected malformed regex pattern `"$.^"` to `"^$"` in ignore pattern caching to ensure proper fallback behavior (`src/fs/mod.rs:291`).
- Derived `Default` trait for `Trie` struct in `src/tui/state/app_state.rs` and `SearchState` struct in `src/tui/state/search.rs` to resolve compiler errors when calling `Self::default()` in their `new()` methods.
- Corrected test script `test_C2_select_all.sh` to accurately verify deselection state by excluding the status bar from checkbox checks.
- **Fixed Duplicate Doc Alias Warning**: Removed duplicate `#[doc(alias = "search-state")]` attribute from `SearchState` struct in `src/tui/state/search.rs`.

### Performance
- **GitIgnore Caching Implementation**: Implemented caching for compiled gitignore matchers, reducing complexity from O(n√óm) to O(1) for repeated path checks in the same directory. This provides significant performance improvements for large codebases with multiple .gitignore files (`src/fs/mod.rs`, `src/tui/state/app_state.rs`).

### Removed
- Removed unused function `perform_search` from `src/tui/state/search.rs`.
- Removed unused function `format_selected_items` from `src/tui/handlers/file_ops.rs`.
- Removed unused method `set_message_duration` from `src/tui/views/message_view.rs`.
