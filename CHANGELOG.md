## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Critical Race Condition in Selection Operations**: Added operation IDs to track async selection operations and prevent race conditions where rapid user interactions could cause count events to apply to wrong selections
- **Nested Gitignore Files Handling**: Fixed bug where nested `.gitignore` files in subdirectories weren't properly handled by implementing file-contextual gitignore matching
- **Selection Limit Violations**: Fixed "Select All" operation that would add items first and check limits later, now pre-checks limits before modifying selection
- **Terminal State Corruption Risk**: Added panic hook to ensure terminal cleanup on crashes, preventing corrupted terminal state
- **WSL Clipboard Error Handling**: Improved error handling and guaranteed cleanup of temporary files in WSL clipboard operations with RAII guard pattern
- **Symlink Loop Detection**: Enhanced symlink loop detection to track both canonical and original paths, preventing infinite recursion in complex symlink scenarios

### Added
- **Atomic Config File Operations**: Implemented atomic write operations for config files to prevent data corruption by writing to temporary file first, then atomically renaming
- **Bounded Event Channels**: Replaced unbounded channels with bounded channels (capacity 100) and added event deduplication to prevent memory growth when UI thread blocks
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Added detailed error messages with specific error codes and context for better debugging of clipboard, file operations, and PowerShell commands

### Changed
- **Optimized File Sorting**: Reduced redundant sorting operations from O(n log n) per directory to O(n log n) total by sorting once after collection instead of at each directory level
- **Improved Gitignore Caching**: Enhanced per-directory context caching for gitignore matchers to reduce repeated lookups for files in the same directory

  - Enhanced test fixtures with special characters, unicode, and large content files
  - Integration with existing test runner (`run_tmux_tests.sh`)
  - Comprehensive documentation in `tests/README_CLI_TESTS.md`
- **Small Test Files Directory**: Created `tests/small_files/` directory with condensed versions of test files
  - All files limited to 10 lines or fewer for faster CLI testing
  - Maintains same structure and file types as `tests/files/` directory
  - Includes Python modules, configuration files, and text patterns
  - Updated `test_CLI_normal_operations.sh` to use small files for improved performance

### Changed
- **Updated .gitignore**: Added patterns for test artifacts and temporary files while preserving test functionality

### Testing
- **Added Comprehensive GitIgnore Testing Suite**: Implemented unit tests to validate and demonstrate the critical gitignore context handling bug described in `CRITICALBUG.md`. Tests include:
  - `test_gitignore_context_issue_demonstration`: Documents current incorrect behavior
  - `test_correct_gitignore_behavior_expectations`: Defines expected correct behavior (currently failing)
  - `test_gitignore_cache_key_problem`: Demonstrates the cache key design flaw
  - `test_file_contextual_gitignore_requirements`: Documents requirements for file-contextual gitignore processing
  - Test infrastructure with nested `.gitignore` files to validate hierarchical ignore pattern handling (`src/fs/mod.rs`)

### Security
- **Fixed Symlink Loop Vulnerability**: Added symlink loop detection in `collect_folder_descendants` function to prevent infinite recursion and potential stack overflow attacks (`src/fs/mod.rs`).

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed Incorrect GitIgnore Context Handling**: Resolved fundamental design flaw where gitignore rules were applied incorrectly due to improper cache key strategy. The previous implementation used only `base_dir` as cache key, causing all files to share the same gitignore matcher regardless of their location in the directory hierarchy. Files are now properly matched against their file-contextual gitignore rules:
  - Implemented `get_cached_gitignore_matcher_for_context()` to build matchers specific to each file's directory context
  - Updated `is_path_ignored_iterative()` and `is_path_ignored_iterative_cached()` to use file's parent directory as context
  - Updated TUI ignore checking in `src/tui/state/app_state.rs` to use file-contextual matching
  - Files now properly respect nested `.gitignore` files (e.g., `src/components/Button.tsx` is correctly ignored by `src/components/.gitignore`)
  - Maintained backward compatibility through deprecated legacy function (`src/fs/mod.rs`)
- **Fixed Race Condition in Selection Operations**: Implemented proper synchronization to prevent race conditions between async selection counting and user input that could cause inconsistent application state (`src/tui/state/selection.rs`, `src/tui/app.rs`).
- **Fixed Incorrect Regex Pattern**: Corrected malformed regex pattern `"$.^"` to `"^$"` in ignore pattern caching to ensure proper fallback behavior (`src/fs/mod.rs:291`).
- Derived `Default` trait for `Trie` struct in `src/tui/state/app_state.rs` and `SearchState` struct in `src/tui/state/search.rs` to resolve compiler errors when calling `Self::default()` in their `new()` methods.
- Corrected test script `test_C2_select_all.sh` to accurately verify deselection state by excluding the status bar from checkbox checks.
- **Fixed Duplicate Doc Alias Warning**: Removed duplicate `#[doc(alias = "search-state")]` attribute from `SearchState` struct in `src/tui/state/search.rs`.

### Performance
- **GitIgnore Caching Implementation**: Implemented caching for compiled gitignore matchers, reducing complexity from O(n×m) to O(1) for repeated path checks in the same directory. This provides significant performance improvements for large codebases with multiple .gitignore files (`src/fs/mod.rs`, `src/tui/state/app_state.rs`).

### Removed
- Removed unused function `perform_search` from `src/tui/state/search.rs`.
- Removed unused function `format_selected_items` from `src/tui/handlers/file_ops.rs`.
- Removed unused method `set_message_duration` from `src/tui/views/message_view.rs`.
