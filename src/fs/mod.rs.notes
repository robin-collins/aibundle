# Notes on Refactoring: Identical if/else Blocks in src/fs/mod.rs

## Context
This notes file documents the changes made to src/fs/mod.rs to resolve Clippy warnings about identical code in if/else branches. The changes were made on [DATE] as part of a linting/code quality improvement pass.

## Summary of Changes
Two locations in src/fs/mod.rs contained if/else blocks where both branches performed the same action. This is redundant and can obscure the code's intent. The affected locations were:

1. **add_items_recursively_inner (around line 158):**
   - The match on `fs::read_dir(root)` had an `Err(e)` arm with:
     ```rust
     if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied {
         return Ok(());
     } else {
         return Ok(());
     }
     ```
   - **Change:** This was replaced with a single `return Ok(());` since both branches did the same thing.

2. **collect_all_subdirs (around line 283):**
   - The match on `fs::read_dir(&current)` had an `Err(e)` arm with:
     ```rust
     if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied {
         continue;
     } else {
         continue;
     }
     ```
   - **Change:** This was replaced with a single `continue;` since both branches did the same thing.

## Rationale
- **Clarity:** Removing redundant branches makes the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Correctness:** The logic is unchanged, as both branches previously performed the same action.
- **Linting:** This resolves the Clippy warning about identical if/else blocks, improving code quality.

## How to Undo
If you wish to revert these changes, simply restore the original if/else structure at the affected locations. For example:

**For add_items_recursively_inner:**
```rust
Err(e) => {
    if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied {
        return Ok(());
    } else {
        return Ok(());
    }
}
```

**For collect_all_subdirs:**
```rust
Err(e) => {
    if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied {
        continue;
    } else {
        continue;
    }
}
```
